This guide covers essential topics to prepare for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam 🚀. Let’s dive into the key concepts, best practices, and services you need to know!

## 🔐 IAM Concepts

- **IAM Users 👤:** Represent individual people or applications with long-term credentials (username, password, access keys).
- **IAM Policies 📜:** JSON documents that define permissions; attached to users, groups, or roles.
- **IAM Groups 👥:** Logical collections of users; apply policies to all members.
- **IAM Roles 🎭:** Provide temporary credentials; used by AWS services, federated users, and cross-account access.

**Good to know:**  
- Use **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** for additional security.  
- Follow the **principle of least privilege** to minimize access risks.

## 🛡️ Networking & Security

- **Security Groups 🛡️:** Act as virtual firewalls at the EC2 instance level.  
  - **Stateful 🔄**: Return traffic is automatically allowed.
  - **Rules:** Only allow (no deny).

- **Network ACLs 🚧:** Work at the subnet level.  
  - **Stateless ↔️**: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed.
  - **Rules:** Can allow or deny.

### VPC Endpoints 🌐

- **Interface Endpoints 🖧:** Use ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) with private IPs to connect securely to AWS services & SaaS apps.
- **Gateway Endpoints 🚪:** Available for S3 & DynamoDB; added directly to your route tables.

## 🖥️ Bastion Host

A secure EC2 instance that lets you SSH/RDP into instances in private subnets 🔐. Best practice: Use with **Security Groups** and enable **session logging**.

## ☁️ S3 & CloudFront

- **S3 🗂️:**  
  - Object storage with **99.999999999% (11 9’s)** durability.  
  - Objects are **private by default**.  
  - Encryption options: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C.

- **CloudFront 🌎:**  
  - Content Delivery Network (CDN).  
  - Distribute static & dynamic content with low latency.  
  - Use **signed URLs/cookies** for secure access.

## ⚖️ Load Balancers

- **Application Load Balancer (ALB) 🌐:**  
  - Operates at Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).  
  - Supports path-based & host-based routing.

- **Network Load Balancer (NLB) ⚡:**  
  - Operates at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP).  
  - Handles millions of requests per second.

- **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) 🔄:**  
  - Operates at Layer 3.  
  - Integrates with security appliances (e.g., firewalls).

## 🔗 AWS Transit Gateway

Central hub that **connects multiple VPCs and on-premises networks**. Scalable and simplifies peering ⭐.

## 🛡️ DDoS Protection & Security Services

- **AWS Shield Standard 🛡️:** Always on; protects against common network/transport layer DDoS attacks.
- **AWS Shield Advanced 🚨:** Enhanced protection with 24/7 DDoS response team support.
- **AWS WAF 🔥:** Web Application Firewall; blocks malicious traffic at the application layer.
- **Amazon GuardDuty 👁️:** Continuous security monitoring; detects threats using ML.
- **Amazon Inspector 🕵️:** Automated security assessment service for EC2 & workloads.
