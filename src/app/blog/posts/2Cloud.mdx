## My First Steps

After earning my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification, I dove into hands-on projects:
- Set up a secure VPC with EC2 instances
- Automated workflows with Lambda
- Managed storage using S3 and lifecycle policies

## Tools I Loved

- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring everything
- **Terraform**: To manage infrastructure as code
- **IAM**: To secure resources properly

## Next Goal

Iâ€™m focusing on mastering CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and learning Kubernetes for container orchestration.
