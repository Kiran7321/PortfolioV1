## The Problem

Repetitive tasks like bulk user creation, mailbox permissions, and reporting were consuming too much time.

## My Solution

I built PowerShell scripts that automated:
- Bulk user onboarding
- Delegating mailbox permissions
- Exporting user reports

Example snippet:

<CodeBlock
    codeInstances={[
      {
        code:
`Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase "OU=Staff,DC=domain,DC=com" | Export-Csv StaffList.csv`
      }
    ]}
/>

## The Impact

These scripts saved my team 10+ hours per week and reduced human errors. Automation is the first step toward thinking like a DevOps engineer!
