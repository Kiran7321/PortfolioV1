## Where Iâ€™m Headed

With a solid foundation in IT support and cloud ops, my next milestones include:

- **Docker**: To package and run apps efficiently
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: To automate software delivery
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus & Grafana

## My Approach

- Follow structured courses
- Build side projects (coming soon on my GitHub, already built a few)
- Connect with mentors and communities on LinkedIn

## Stay Tuned

Iâ€™ll be sharing updates as I hit each milestone!
