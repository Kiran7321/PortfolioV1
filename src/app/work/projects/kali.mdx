## Overview

This post documents the installation and configuration of **Kali Linux** on a **Microsoft Surface Book**, leveraging the custom Surface Linux kernel to enable device-specific functionality. The process includes setting up display scaling, Wi-Fi, power management, and resolving two major issues post-installation: kernel regression and captive portal access on public networks.

## Key Features

- **Custom Surface Linux Kernel**: Installed a tailored kernel that supports the Surface Book's hardware, enabling touchscreen, better display scaling, and battery monitoring.
- **Display Configuration**: Configured GNOME to handle the high-DPI screen (2736x1824 resolution), ensuring UI elements render correctly.
- **Package Installation**: Used `dpkg` to install older kernel `.deb` packages to stabilize device-specific drivers.
- **Wi-Fi and Networking**: Diagnosed and resolved issues with public Wi-Fi captive portals by identifying the proper URL to trigger redirection.

## Technologies Used

- **Kali Linux (Rolling Release)**: For penetration testing and security workflows.
- **Surface Linux Kernel (linux-surface)**: From linux-surface GitHub repo, to add Surface-specific hardware support.
- **GNOME Desktop Environment**: For a modern, scalable UI.

## Issues Faced

**❌ Issue #1**: Kernel Instability with Latest Version

Problem:
After installing the latest linux-surface kernel (v6.15+), the device is not showing the battery status, and touch screen is not working.

Solution:
Downgraded to kernel version 6.8.x by manually downloading .deb packages and installing them using:

sudo dpkg -i linux-image-6.8.x-surface*.deb linux-headers-6.8.x-surface*.deb
This restored stability and compatibility with Surface Book hardware.

**❌ Issue #2**: Public Wi-Fi Captive Portal Not Loading

Problem:
When connecting to public Wi-Fi (e.g., airport or café), the captive portal did not show up, making it impossible to sign in and access the network.

Root Cause:
GNOME's NetworkManager didn't auto-trigger the portal redirection.

Solution:
Manually open the following URL in a browser to trigger the captive portal:

**http://nmcheck.gnome.org/**

After authentication, the network became usable.

## Outcome

The final setup results in a fully functional Kali Linux environment on the Surface Book, with touch support, high-DPI scaling, working sleep mode, and stable Wi-Fi — even on public networks. The installation required a few manual steps, but the end result is a highly portable, powerful pentesting machine.
